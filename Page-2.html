<h2>Essentially, there are 5 types of waste. These include;</h2>


	<h3>Liquid waste </h3>

<img src="https://u.osu.edu/wastemanagement/files/2017/03/1-1xww1wl.jpg" height="300" width="600">

<p>liquid waste is essentially Liquids as wastewater, fats, oils or grease (FOG), used oil, liquids, solids, gases, or sludges, sewerage and hazardous household liquids. These liquids that are very harmful to the human health or the environment. They can also commercial products classified as “Liquid Industrial Waste” such as cleaning fluids or pesticides, or the by-products of manufacturing processes.  There are general regulatory requirements relating to waste, additional regulations apply to generating, storing, transporting, treating and disposing of hazardous and liquid wastes. <i>(E-waste Disposal Inc., n.d) </i> </p>

	<h3>Solid rubbish</h3>

<p>Solid waste is basically any garbage, refuse or sludge from a wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant or and air pollution control facility, it can also include other disposed materials like Soils and other semi-solid wastes. Examples of these include;</i> </p>

<ul style="color: white;">
	<li>waste tires </li>
	<li>septage</li>
	<li>scrap metal</li>
	<li>latex paints</li>
	<li>furniture and toys</li>
	<li>garbage </li>
	<li>appliances and vehicles</li>
	<li>oil and anti-freeze </li>
	<li>empty aerosol cans, paint cans and compressed gas cylinders </li>
	<li>construction and demolition debris, asbestos</li>
</ul>

	<h3>Organic waste</h3>

<p>Organic waste is the type of waste that is produced by plants and animals. Moreover, this type of waste is also biodegradable. Organic waste produces either produce carbon dioxide which is a greenhouse gas and causes the greenhouse effect which can lead to the increase of global warming and resulting into the melting of ice caps, thus, the rise of sea levels and then the displacement or even death of humans and animals, or methane gas which is also very harmful to our environment because in small concentrations, it is highly flammable I.e. 5% - 15%. In addition, in high concentration, it can replace the oxygen and it will make it very hard for us to breathe.<i>(cityofsignalhill, n.d.) (heatingandprocess, 2016)</i> </p>

	<h3>Recyclable rubbish</h3>

<p>Recyclable waste is, just as the name is explained, waste that has the possibility to be recycled because it is not fully exhausted or simply just cannot be exhausted. Examples or recyclable waste include glass, specific types of plastics, water, steel, aluminum cans, even newspapers. Sometimes these wastes are found either just disposed or mixed with the non-recyclable waste and some of it gets spoilt due to it. An example of this case can be newspapers. Which can be recycles as paper to pack goods like food and more. However, if the newspaper comes into contact with dirty water, it will not be usable at all because it will become soggy and the best way to clean is it to use clean water but that has a high chance of ruining the whole paper resulting into the waste of the newspaper and water too.  </i> </p>

	<h3>Hazardous waste</h3>

<p>Just as the name suggests, hazardous waste is a type of waste that imposes a potential threat to either the public’s health or the environment. For waste to qualify to be Hazardous, it has to meet at least one of the four characteristics of Hazardous waste. They include:</i> </p>

<ul style="color: white; margin: 10px  10px  10px  10px " >
	<li>Ignitability</li>
	<li>Reactivity</li>
	<li>Corrosivity</li>
	<li>Toxicity</li> <br> <i>(Wikipedia, 2019)</i>
</ul>

<p>The picture above is a real life example of Hazardous waste that is released into water bodies. This is the Animas River in Colorado in 2015 when about 3 million gallons of toxic waste was released into the river <i>(Inhabitat, 2015)</i> </p>
